# DS18B20-temperature
[Sensor DS18B20](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS18B20.pdf)

Build will be part of to my 3D printer monitoring project. 

Sensor signal connects to NodeMCU board D6. 

MicroPython firmware includes sensor drivers. Just copy and run the main.py on NodeMCU board
(assume MicroPython firmware already flashed).
